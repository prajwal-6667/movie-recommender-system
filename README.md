# movie-recommender-system
🎯 Project Overview:
I have developed an ML-based Movie Recommender System that intelligently suggests movies based on user preferences. This system, built using a Kaggle dataset, incorporates data pre-processing techniques and utilizes cosine similarity for generating accurate recommendations.

📊 Data Pre-processing:
To ensure the highest quality recommendations, I dedicated considerable effort to data cleaning, proficient data handling, and strategic feature engineering.

⚙️ Model Building:
I harnessed the power of cosine similarity to identify movie similarities and deliver tailored recommendations to users.

💻 Implementation Details:
For real-time recommendations, I deployed the model within a Python environment using PyCharm and the "pickle" library.

📲 Streamlit Web App:
With user convenience in mind, I created an intuitive web app using Streamlit. This user-friendly interface empowers users to input their favorite movies and receive personalized recommendations swiftly.

🖼️ Movie Posters from themoviedb.org:
I aimed to enhance the user experience by integrating the app with the themoviedb.org API. This integration seamlessly displays movie posters alongside the recommendations, enriching the visual aspect of the interface.

Undertaking this project allowed me to delve deeper into machine learning concepts, and it provided me with an opportunity to explore tools such as PyCharm and Jupyter. I am particularly thankful to Nitish Singh for his invaluable guidance throughout this journey. Furthermore, the assistance of ChatGPT proved instrumental in completing this project.
